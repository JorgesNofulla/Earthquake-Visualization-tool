# Earthquake Visualization Map

## Overview
This project provides an interactive map visualization of global earthquake data. It utilizes data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) to plot earthquake occurrences on a world map, categorizing them by magnitude and providing detailed information on demand. The map is equipped with multiple layers and styles, enhancing the user's ability to perceive and analyze seismic activity patterns.

## Features
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Automatically fetches the latest earthquake data from the USGS.
- **Layered Visualization**: Categorizes earthquakes based on their magnitude and presents them in distinct layers that can be toggled by the user.
- **Interactive Elements**: Each earthquake marker provides detailed information, including magnitude, depth, and time of occurrence.
- **Custom Map Styles**: Includes various map styles like CartoDB, Esri World Imagery, and CartoDB Dark Matter, allowing users to switch views according to their preference.
- **Heatmap Overlay**: Provides a heatmap layer to visualize the concentration of seismic activities.
- **Responsive Design**: The map is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

## Installation and usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the requirements file. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the `run.py` script to generate the map. The map will be saved as an HTML file named `enhanced_earthquakes_map_with_layers
